Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset
About
This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship tasks.
I worked on the Titanic dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The goal was to find important patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

What I Did
Loaded the Titanic dataset and explored it using .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts().

Checked for missing values.

Plotted different graphs like histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, pairplots, and heatmaps.

Observed the plots carefully and noted down important points.

Summarized the main findings based on the data.

Key Observations
Age and class had a strong relationship with survival chances.

Some features had missing values that needed attention.

Found correlations between variables using heatmap and pairplot.

Files Included
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing code and analysis.

PDF report summarizing the findings.

What I Learned
By doing this task, I improved my skills in data handling, visualization, and finding insights from raw data.
